<h2>About this guide</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Build tools are an essential part of modern computer programming. They bridge the gap between humans and computers, acting as translators between human- and computer-language. Compilers translate human-readable source code into assembly language. Assemblers translate assembly language into machine code. Linkers translate bits of machine code into larger executables. Makefiles tell the computer how to translate our source code. Debuggers translate machine code into human-readable text. With build tools, we can talk to the computer without speaking in ones and zeroes.<br /><br />We use build tools to speak in a way that comes naturally to us. They help us write code in a way that’s intuitive and comfortable to us, saving time and energy. They abstract unnecessary details, keeping us from dwelling on the complexities of the machine. Build tools can drastically increase our time- and energy-efficiency while programming.<br /><br />This guide will teach you about the most important build tools for C and C++ to increase your productivity, whether you’re a hobbyist or working at a Fortune 500 company. First, you’ll learn the basic concepts behind build tools and how to set them up. Then, we’ll dive into the details of compilers, Makefiles, CMake, and debuggers.

<h2>Ethics</h2>
Developers should commit to the analysis, design and development of software in
order to make software development a beneficial and respected profession.
In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public,
software engineers shall adhere to the following six Principles:
<h4>Public</h4>
- Keep in mind the general saftey of the public.
Approve software only if they have a well-founded
belief that it is safe and dislose any potential dangers to
the proper people/ussers.
<h4>Client and Employer</h4>
- Provide service in their areas of competence, being honest and forthright about any
 limitations of their experience and education. Use the property of a client or
 employer only in ways properly authorized, and with the client’s or employer’s knowledge and consent.

<h4>Product</h4>
- Strive for high quality, acceptable cost and a reasonable schedule, ensuring
significant tradeoffs are clear to and accepted by the employer and the client, and are
available for consideration by the user and the public.

<h4>Judgment</h4>
- Maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment. Not engage in
deceptive financial practices such as bribery, double billing, or other improper
financial practices.

<h4>Management</h4>
- Ensure good management for any project on which they work, including
effective procedures for promotion of quality and reduction of risk.
Subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
